### Will VA help me at all with gathering evidence?

Yes. 

**Under the Fully Developed Claims program, we’ll:** 
- Request relevant medical records that you identify and authorize us to get from a federal facility, like a VA medical center, **and**

### When should I turn in my evidence? 

To submit your claim through the Fully Developed Claims program, you’ll need to turn in the information and evidence at the same time you file your claim.

**Note:** If you turn in more information or evidence after you send in your fully developed claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and process it as a standard claim. If we decide your claim before one year from the date we receive the claim, you’ll have the rest of that one-year period to turn in additional information or evidence to support your claim.
