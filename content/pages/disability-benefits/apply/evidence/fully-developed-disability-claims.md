<div itemprop="text">

**You'll need to send us all:**

<h3 itemprop="name">Are there any risks to using the Fully Developed Claims program?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

No. Filing a fully developed claim won't affect the attention we give to your claim or the benefits you're entitled to receive.

If we determine that we need other non-federal records to make a decision on your claim, we'll simply the claim from the Fully Developed Claims program and process it as a standard claim. 

Once you start your fully developed claim, you'll have up to one year to complete it. Should VA approve your claim, you'll be paid back to the day you started your claim.

### Will VA help me at all with gathering evidence?

Yes. 

**Under the Fully Developed Claims program, we’ll:** 
- Request relevant medical records that you identify and authorize us to get from a federal facility, like a VA medical center, **and**
- Request relevant private medical records that you authorize us to get from a non-VA hospital or doctor
- Schedule a health exam or get a medical opinion for you, if we decide we need it for your claim

<br>

### When should I turn in my evidence? 

To submit your claim through the Fully Developed Claims program, you’ll need to turn in the information and evidence at the same time you file your claim.

**Note:** If you turn in more information or evidence after you send in your fully developed claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and process it as a standard claim. If we decide your claim before one year from the date we receive the claim, you’ll have the rest of that one-year period to turn in additional information or evidence to support your claim.

<br>

### How do I turn in my information and evidence?

You can start your online application right now, or find out how to apply by mail, in person, or with the help of a trained professional.<br>
