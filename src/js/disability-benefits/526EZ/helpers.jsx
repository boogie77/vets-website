    <h3>Types of evidence</h3>
    <h4>VA medical records</h4>
    <p>If you were treated at a VA medical center or clinic, or by a doctor through the TRICARE health care program, you’ll have VA medical records.</p>
    <h4>Private medical records</h4>
    <p>If you were treated by a private doctor, including a Veteran’s Choice doctor, you’ll have private medical records.
      We’ll need to see those records to make a decision on your claim. A Disability Benefit Questionnaire is an example of a private medical record.</p>
    <h4>Lay statements or other evidence</h4>
    <p>A lay statement is a written statement from family, friends, or coworkers to help support your claim. Lay statement are also called “buddy statements.” In most cases, you only need your medical records to support your disability claim. Some claims, for example, for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder or for military sexual trauma, could benefit from a lay or buddy statement.</p>
